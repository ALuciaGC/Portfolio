# Breast Cancer Diagnosis: AI Model Comparison

This project focuses on comparing the performance of two AI models—Logistic Regression and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)—in diagnosing breast cancer. Utilizing the Wisconsin breast cancer dataset, this work involved applying advanced machine learning techniques, with careful consideration of overfitting. The project evaluated both models using accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC metrics, demonstrating the practical application of AI in medical diagnostics.

# Data Description

## Overview

This project utilizes synthetic datasets generated by the [AMLSim platform](https://github.com/IBM/AMLSim), which is specifically designed to simulate anti-money laundering scenarios. The synthetic data addresses the confidentiality and de-anonymization challenges associated with real-world AML datasets. AMLSim generates data by creating a graph-based network that simulates bank account transactions, some of which are designed to mimic fraudulent activities.

## Datasets

Three primary datasets were used in this study:

1. **Accounts Dataset**:
   - **Total Instances**: 100,000 bank accounts
   - **Classes**: 82,909 normal accounts, 17,091 fraudulent accounts

     - `CUSTOMER_ID`: Identifier for the customer owning the account.
     - `INIT_BALANCE`: Initial balance in the account.
     - `COUNTRY`: Country associated with the account.
     - `ACCOUNT_TYPE`: Type of the account (e.g., individual, corporate).
     - `IS_FRAUD`: Boolean indicator of whether the account is fraudulent.
     - `TX_BEHAVIOR_ID`: Identifier representing transaction behavior associated with the account.

2. **Transactions Dataset**:
   - **Total Instances**: 12,476,012 transactions
   - **Classes**: 12,458,960 normal transactions, 17,052 money laundering transactions
   - **Key Features**:
     - `TX_ID`: Unique identifier for each transaction.
     - `SENDER_ACCOUNT_ID`: Identifier for the account initiating the transaction.
     - `RECEIVER_ACCOUNT_ID`: Identifier for the account receiving the transaction.
     - `TX_TYPE`: Type of transaction (e.g., transfer, deposit).
     - `TX_AMOUNT`: Amount of money involved in the transaction.
     - `TIMESTAMP`: Time at which the transaction occurred.
     - `IS_FRAUD`: Boolean indicator of whether the transaction is fraudulent.
     - `ALERT_ID`: Identifier for any alert generated for the transaction.

3. **Alerts Dataset**:
   - **Total Instances**: 17,052 alerts
   - **Classes**: Alerts correspond to the 17,052 fraudulent transactions identified in the Transactions dataset.
   - **Key Features**:
     - `ALERT_ID`: Unique identifier for each alert.
     - `ALERT_TYPE`: Type or category of alert (e.g., cycle, fan_in).
     - `IS_FRAUD`: Boolean indicator of whether the alert corresponds to a fraudulent transaction.
     - `TX_ID`: Identifier for the transaction associated with the alert.
     - `SENDER_ACCOUNT_ID`: Identifier for the account that initiated the transaction.
     - `RECEIVER_ACCOUNT_ID`: Identifier for the account that received the transaction.

# AI-Powered Money Laundering Detection

This project focuses on enhancing money laundering detection for financial institutions through a deep technical analysis of AML models. The work involved the application of advanced skills in Python, SQL, Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn, along with sophisticated data visualization techniques. By refining feature engineering and data processing methods, this project demonstrates the transformative potential of AI in addressing complex financial challenges.

## Jupyter Notebooks
- Initial Data Analysis.ipynb: This notebook covers the initial exploration of the dataset used for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) detection. It includes data cleaning, exploration of data distributions, and identification of key features relevant to the detection process.

- Feature Engineering.ipynb: This notebook focuses on the process of feature engineering, where raw data is transformed into a format suitable for machine learning models. It includes techniques for creating new features, handling missing values, and optimizing the dataset for model performance.

- Simplified GNN.ipynb: This notebook details the implementation of a Simplified Graph Neural Network (GNN) model for AML detection. It covers the model architecture, training process, and evaluation metrics used to assess the model's performance.

- Hybrid Approach.ipynb: This notebook explores a hybrid approach that combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with autoencoders to enhance AML detection. It includes model design, training, and a comparative analysis of performance against other models.

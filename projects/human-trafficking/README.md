# Human Trafficking Pattern Identification

This project leverages data science techniques to identify patterns in human trafficking, focusing on victims' origins and types of exploitation. The analysis supports awareness efforts in humanitarian and criminal justice fields, utilizing data from the Counter Trafficking Data Collaborative (CTDC).

## Data Source

The data used in this project was sourced from the [Counter Trafficking Data Collaborative (CTDC)](https://www.ctdatacollaborative.org/), a global data hub on human trafficking. The dataset includes information on victims' country of origin and the type of exploitation they were subjected to, providing valuable insights for combating trafficking networks.

## Methodology

The analysis involved preprocessing the dataset to handle missing values and imbalances, followed by the application of machine learning models, including logistic regression and decision trees, to classify and predict trafficking patterns. Key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC were used to evaluate model performance.

## Results

The models developed in this project successfully identified significant patterns in the dataset, aiding in the understanding of human trafficking dynamics and informing strategies for intervention and prevention.

# Ana Lucía García Cantú - Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! I am a computer scientist with a passion for leveraging technology to address global challenges. My background spans international affairs, data science, and artificial intelligence, with over 5 years of experience at the United Nations and in the private sector.

## About Me

Having recently completed a Master’s in Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence at Northumbria University, UK, with a concentration in machine learning, deep learning, object-oriented programming, and data analytics, I bring a well-rounded blend of strategic insight and technical prowess.

My thesis placed me at the cutting edge of AI and deep learning applications, particularly in enhancing Anti-Money Laundering (AML) detection for financial institutions. By integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and autoencoders, I developed and optimized models that significantly improved the accuracy and efficiency of fraud detection systems.

## Areas of Expertise

- **Machine Learning & AI**: Skilled in building and deploying models using Python, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and other machine learning libraries.
- **Data Science**: Proficient in data manipulation, statistical modeling, and data visualization using tools like SQL, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau, and Flourish.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Strong foundation in designing and implementing object-oriented solutions, particularly in Java, with experience in creating interactive applications and game development.
- **Web Development**: Experience in developing responsive web applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **International Affairs**: Extensive experience in project management, communications, and policy analysis, particularly in the areas of human trafficking, gender equality, and sustainable development.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

### [AI-Powered Money Laundering Detection](./projects/aml-detection/README.md)
A project focused on enhancing money laundering detection for financial institutions through a deep technical analysis of AML models. This work involved the application of advanced skills in Python, SQL, Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn, along with sophisticated data visualization techniques. By refining feature engineering and data processing methods, this project demonstrated the transformative potential of AI in addressing complex financial challenges.

### [Breast Cancer Diagnosis: AI Model Comparison](./projects/br-cancer-diagnosis/README.md)
A project focused on comparing the performance of two AI models—Logistic Regression and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)—in diagnosing breast cancer. Utilizing the Wisconsin breast cancer dataset, this work involved applying advanced machine learning techniques, with careful consideration of overfitting. The project evaluated both models using accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC metrics, demonstrating the practical application of AI in medical diagnostics.

### [Sokoban Game Implementation](./projects/sokoban/README.md)
A project focused on creating a Sokoban game using Java, where the goal was to design a graphical user interface that allows players to enjoy the classic Sokoban puzzle game. Although some base files were provided by the university, the project involved significant custom development, particularly in the SokobanPanel and PanelCell classes, which are responsible for rendering the game grid, handling user input, and managing game state.

### [Human Trafficking Pattern Identification](./projects/ht-pattern-identification/README.md)
Leveraging data science to map human trafficking networks, focusing on victims' origins and types of exploitation. This project supports awareness efforts in humanitarian and criminal justice fields, based on data from the Counter Trafficking Data Collaborative, despite challenges with incomplete data.
